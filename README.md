# Build a whitelist dApp for an upcoming NFT Collection

This project is realized by Wecks following this course of [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/courses/c1d7081b-63a9-4c6e-b35c-9fcbbad418b2/lessons/8f68b61a-14b2-429f-9fd3-2d2e8211421f)

I will use the hardhat builder here and code this Dapp in solidity/javascript.

## Front-end

For the front-end part, some JS frameworks like React and Next Js will be used along with the [Web3Modal library](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal).

## Result

[Here](https://dao-lw-3-my-app-4pl2.vercel.app/) is the webpage which I have created with this code.
